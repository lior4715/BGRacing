# Cone Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview
The project implements cone detection using YOLOv8. Given a dataset of cones, the project distinguishes between orange, blue and yellow cones (also distinguishes between regular and large orange cones).
The project can train the model from scratch while also being able to use pretrained weights and resume training from a certain block of progress.
The project draws a rectangle with the cone's color and confidence score (from 0 to 1).

Operating System: Windows 11
